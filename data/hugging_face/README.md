# Hugging Face

The hugging face API enables us to upload datasets.

I wanted to try to upload the clean dataset of the Image Net Dogs so I could use it in this project by simply downloading it.

Other developers could then also use this preprocessed dataset to easily start doing predictions.

I followed the [hugging face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/image_dataset) and [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S20nblUuNw&list=PLIUOU7oqGTLg1Sc7lQ4TVXDaOBRb0uAHY) to upload the dataset

# Use

In this folder was cloned the [stanford-dogs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Alanox/stanford-dogs) dataset.
Info was added to this folder from this project with the `main.py` script
